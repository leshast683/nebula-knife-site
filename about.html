        <section class="about-intro">
            <p>Nebula & Knife was created as a culinary lab where technique, timing, and presentation work together like a well-run mission. Our concept blends modern fine dining with space-inspired atmosphere, giving guests an experience that feels immersive but grounded in real flavor. Every detail — from heat control to plating geometry — is intentional.</p>

        <section class="about-story">
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Nebula & Knife began with a simple idea: great cooking is both art and engineering. The founding chefs wanted to build a restaurant where experimentation is encouraged but discipline is never ignored. By combining modern culinary science with global flavor influences, the kitchen produces dishes that look unexpected yet taste balanced and satisfying. What started as a concept project evolved into a full dining experience focused on precision and creativity.</p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Our mission is to deliver high-impact dining through precision technique, controlled execution, and bold but thoughtful flavor design. We focus on ingredient quality, temperature accuracy, and texture contrast to make every plate memorable. Guests should leave feeling surprised, satisfied, and eager to return for the next seasonal evolution of the menu.</p>

            <h2>The Kitchen Approach</h2>
            <p>Our kitchen operates like a lab — structured, collaborative, and always improving. Techniques are documented, timing is tested, and plating is rehearsed so service runs smoothly even during peak hours. Innovation is welcome, but only when it improves the guest experience. The result is food that feels creative without being chaotic.</p>
