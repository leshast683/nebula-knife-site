For this assignment, I built a contact form that checks user input before submitting. In simple words, it makes sure the name and email fields are not empty, checks if the email looks correct, shows error messages if something is wrong, and shows a success message if everything is filled out properly. Before this, the form would submit even if the fields were empty, so this made it more professional and user-friendly.

At first, micro-iteration felt a little frustrating. I'm used to asking the AI to generate everything at once. Breaking it into small steps felt slower in the beginning. But after a few steps, I realized it actually helped me feel more in control. I wasn't dealing with a huge block of code. I could focus on one small part, test it, understand it, and then move on. It made the process feel more organized and less stressful.

When I asked the AI to review its own code, it caught that I forgot to reset the form after a successful submission. It also noticed that validation wasn't stopping the form from submitting in one version. I liked that it consistently caught logic mistakes and missing error handling. However, it didn't catch small design problems, like spacing issues or how the error text looked on mobile. I had to fix those myself.

Using Claude in the browser was simple and easy to understand. I liked how clearly it explained the code. The downside is that I had to copy and paste everything into my project, which feels a little manual. A CLI tool feels more powerful, but also easier to mess something up if you're not careful.

I would use micro-iteration for features that involve logic or multiple steps. I would skip it for small styling changes because it feels unnecessary for simple fixes.
